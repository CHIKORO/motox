<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>A Ticking Entity crash will be caused when some form of data, typically a&nbsp;mob&nbsp;or block, in the world becomes corrupted. This will usually be displayed in a crash report as follows:&nbsp;java.lang.nullpointerexception: ticking entity</p>



<p>The corruption that can happen in relation to ticking entities can be so severe that anytime the game attempts to process the ticking entity it will crash. While you can see these crashes in a&nbsp;Vanilla world, you are more likely to come across this when playing a modded world. This is purely due to the fact that mods tend to change major aspects of minecraft and can be seen as a more unstable way to play the game.</p>



<h3>Minecraft Ticks</h3>



<p>Ticks are going to be involved with every game you may play. Ticks can be seen as loops of tasks a game does to synchronize itself. Minecraft runs its game loop at a fixed rate of 20&nbsp;ticks per second. This equates to 1 tick every 0.05 seconds. One good example of ticks is the daylight cycle in Minecraft. Each day is 24,000 ticks. This means 1 day in Minecraft equals 20 minutes in real life. Anything you are doing in game will be put in the same loop to be synchronized with the rest of the world.</p>



<h2>Ticking Block &amp; Ticking World</h2>



<h3>Ticking Block</h3>



<p>A Ticking Block crash is generally the same as a Ticking Entity. The difference with this crash is it is related to a block or Tile Entity specifically and not a mob or npc. This will generally be related to special blocks added from a mod.</p>



<h3>Ticking World</h3>



<p>A Ticking World crash is the most severe of them all. This will occur when the game is able to recognize that there is corruption in the world, but will not be able to give a location. The game will have no idea where the corruption occurred and in some cases this is unfixable.<br>Once you have become subjected to a Ticking Entity crash you will have to remove the data from your world to resolve it. Simply removing your mods will not work in this case. This is due to the corruption already being part of your world. Luckily there are multiple ways you can remove the errored entity from your world. Some fixes might work better than others and it will really depend on the specific crash you are facing.</p>



<p>If you discover that even after removing the errored entity the crashing keeps occurring, you may have a faulty mod. If this is the case it is important to find the specific mod/s that are causing this to be able to fix the crashes in the long run. Unfortunately there is no easy way to do this. We would recommend removing any recent additions of Mods to start. If the crashes continue you may want to start removing mods in batches until the issues stop. This will better help you narrow down which mod exactly is causing the problems.</p>



<h2>How to fix a Ticking Entity</h2>



<p>It is very important to resolve this crash as soon as possible. If the erroring entity is not removed your server may backup your world with the errored entity included. In some cases this could remove your only option to fixing the issue.</p>



<h3>Restore from Backup</h3>



<p>The absolute easiest and most straightforward way to fix the Ticking Entity is by restoring a backup() of your world. At Any Hosting we will automatically set up a backup task when you purchase a server. This task will run once per day and save up to two backups on your server at a time. We have a great guide on the restoration process&nbsp;here.</p>



<h3>Crash Reports</h3>



<p>When the server crashes due to a Ticking Entity the&nbsp;crash report&nbsp;will have very important information that can be used in the removal of the errored entity. The following information will be inside of the crash reports:</p>



<ol><li>Type of entity that caused the crash</li><li>Exact coordinates where the Ticking Entity is located.</li></ol>



<p>Below is an example of what you will typically see in a crash report if you experience a ticking entity crash.</p>

A detailed walkthrough of the error, its code path and all known details is as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>



<p>As you can see the description lets us know this is a Ticking Entity crash. If you look closely you can also see that the entity Shulker Ghast is mentioned. Upon even closer inspection you can see that this is coming from a possible mod called MMM. In this case you can do a quick google search to figure out that this entity has been added by the mod&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/5104592084804196716#">Mutated Mobs Mod</a>.</p>



<h3>Ticking World</h3>



<p>If the description in the crash report shows Ticking World or Exception ticking world you will not be able to find exact coordinates of the errored entity. This is due to the world not knowing where the issue is thus not being able to display coordinates. In these cases, we would just recommend you restore a backup() of your world.</p>



<h3>Ticking Entity</h3>



<p>If you take a look further down in the crash report you will be able to find the exact X, Y, Z Coordinates of the ticking entity. Below is an example of this information.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">A detailed walkthrough of the error, its code path and all known details is as follows:

<p>In the Entity being ticked section you will find all the important information regarding the errored entity. You can more easily see here that it indeed is a ShulkerGhast from the MMM mod. The exact location of the entity is going to be&nbsp;<code>183.54, 51.95, 67.90</code>.</p>



<h3>Cofh Killall Command to Remove Entity</h3>



<p>If you have the mod&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/5104592084804196716#">CoFH Core</a>&nbsp;you will have access to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/5104592084804196716#">/cofh killall command</a>. This command is an improved version of the default Minecraft kill command. You will not need to be connected to the server to run this command. However the server will need to be able to startup in order for the command to be run.</p>



<p>This command will have the ability to kill all creatures even in unloaded chunks on the server. This is crucial as if the chunk loads that has the ticking entity the server will end up crashing. Although CoFH Core is very common you may not have it installed. It is recommended to add this mod to your server’s&nbsp;mods&nbsp;folder to gain access to this command.</p>



<p>In order to remove all loaded entities of a specific type you can use the following command.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">/cofh killall [type]</pre>



<p>The [type] you will enter is going to be the name or part of the name of the entity type to remove from the server. You can also run without a type that will remove all hostile mobs from the server. If for some reason the type is not working you can force the command to remove ALL loaded entities with this command:&nbsp;<code>/cofh killall *</code></p>



<h3>Teleport to the Mob and Kill it</h3>



<p>This would be the “low tech” way to fix the ticking entity. Using the given coordinates from the crash report you can teleport to the entity and in the split second before the crash attempt to kill it in one hit. We recommend putting yourself into creative mode with /gamemode creative and getting a weapon that could instantly kill the entity.</p>



<p>Once you are in creative mode and have a weapon ready you can run the /teleport command to travel to the entity and start swinging away.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">/teleport X Y Z</pre>



<h3>Forge Mod Loader (DANGER)</h3>



<p>One other way to fix the Ticking Entity would be by enabling certain features within the Forge Modloader.&nbsp;Forge&nbsp;will have two settings that will order Minecraft to remove any mobs or blocks that would cause the server to crash. This method of resolution is completely uncontrollable as forge will be given permission to remove anything and everything it deems necessary. If you have ever watched forge startup in console you will know that it will almost always give warnings or errors about one thing or another. This could cause forge to remove things you do not want it to.</p>



<p>WARNING:&nbsp;If you attempt to use this method, make a backup of your server. We cannot stress how much damage this can do to your world, and the damage cannot be fixed. The only way to undo these changes is to restore a backup made before you turned on these settings in Forge, or by restoring a saved copy of your world.&nbsp;Customer Support&nbsp;can not restore any parts of a world deleted by Forge because of these settings, unless you made a backup beforehand.</p>



<p>To turn on these settings, you must find the file forge.cfg, which is normally located in the config folder in the main directory. Select forge.cfg, and then click the edit button to the right of the file.</p>



<p>Find the word false and change it to true. It’s recommended to only turn on the setting appropriate to what you are trying to fix: If trying to correct a Ticking Entity change the one for removeErrorEntities to true, but leave the removeErroringTileEntities set to false. This will hopefully minimize the side effects.</p>



<p>Start the server up, let it finish running. Then immediately shut the server down, open up forge.cfg and change those settings back to false. Leaving them permanently set to true can have continuous side effects. Place a block, and it instantly disappears, because forge didn’t like it and zapped it out of existence.</p>



<p>Try connecting into your game, and check to make sure everything is okay. If you see entire structures and buildings gone, well, that’s the damage we were talking about. If this happened, restore the backup made before turning on the&nbsp;Forge settings, and try one of the other alternative methods of removing the Ticking Entity.</p>

<h2>How to make a Bed in Minecraft</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn.apexminecrafthosting.com/img/uploads/2020/12/17184700/bed-crafting-recipe.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>So, you’re a Minecraft noob and you’re tired of digging yourself into a hidey-hole every night when the monsters come out. You hate having to wait until sunrise for the safety of a bright and shiny plain. Worry not, Minecraft noob! We got the thing for you: Beds. Brand spankin’ new (not really) technology brought straight from Mojang HQ that allows you to skip the night entirely, and set a new spawn point. That’s right. Today’s blog will go over beds in Minecraft. Everything, from how they work to the history that surrounds them, and maybe even their future. Let’s get started!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn.apexminecrafthosting.com/img/uploads/2020/12/17184712/bed.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h3>Shleep</h3>



<p>Beds are a fairly simple and well known part of Minecraft. They have a few uses, which include but are not limited to sleeping through the night and setting the player’s spawn point. To do this, the player needs to press the ‘use’ button (on Java Edition, this is RMB by default) on the bed. Beds do not work if monsters are within an 8-block radius horizontally. Beds also do not work if it is daytime. It must be either night, or a thunderstorm. After around five seconds of a sleeping animation, the world will turn to day, and you will jump out of bed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn.apexminecrafthosting.com/img/uploads/2020/12/17184705/Phantoms.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>As of 1.13, not sleeping for more than three days will result in the spawning of Phantoms at night. Phantoms are airborne hellspawn that exist solely to ruin your life. They will swoop in and slap you, quickly ascending back up to a safe elevation. The longer you go without sleep, the more that will spawn each night. Phantoms are player specific, so if you get a good night’s rest while your friends have insomnia, you should be left alone.</p>



<p>Beds naturally spawn in igloos, and some specific Village houses, but they can also be crafted for fairly cheap. All you need is&nbsp;3 wooden planks of any kind, and 3 matching wool. Make sure that you shear matching Sheep! When placed, Beds take up two blocks of space, so make some room in your crib!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn.apexminecrafthosting.com/img/uploads/2020/12/17184700/bed-crafting-recipe.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>As for ‘occupied’ beds, players cannot use a bed in use by another player. However, if a Villager is sleeping in a bed, just kick that sucker out by using it! They’ll jump upright in respect for the superior combatant, you! It may be a bit mean, but it’s a tough world out there!</p>



<h3>Factoids and Trivia</h3>



<p>Here’s a list of random facts and functions about beds that won’t be helpful or necessary to know for most of you, but should be included in this blog nevertheless! I’m quite thorough, you know?</p>



<p>Bouncing&nbsp;– Landing on a bed will reduce fall damage by 50% and bounce you up for 66% of the impact velocity. Essentially, if you fall high you’ll bounce high too. Baby Villagers bounce on beds during the day.</p>



<p>What Fall Damage?&nbsp;– If a player falls a considerable height, and uses a bed before reaching the ground, the fall damage is not nullified but activated when they leave the bed. Yikes!</p>



<p>Spawn Points&nbsp;– Although the player cannot sleep in a bed during the day, using the bed still sets a new spawn point. Safety assured!</p>



<p>Friends&nbsp;– In Multiplayer, all server residents must sleep simultaneously for the day to pass. Otherwise, any player sleeping will sit in a perpetual slumber!</p>



<p>Waterlogged Beds&nbsp;– If a bed is waterlogged, meaning the bed has water sources registered on it, the player cannot sleep in it without the Water Breathing Effect, or Conduit Power.</p>



<p>Boom!&nbsp;– Beds cannot be slept in when placed in other dimensions, but you won’t just get a message. You’re in for a treat if you try this!</p>



<p>Take Care of Yourself&nbsp;– Players cannot sleep while on fire, poisoned, or starving. For good reason too, you got bigger problems!</p>



<p>The Colors&nbsp;– Originally, Beds only had one color. Red.</p>



<p>Culture?&nbsp;– Each type of Village has its own set of colored beds that spawn in their buildings. For Example, Savanna Villages only spawn with red or yellow beds.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Welp, that’s everything! You now know what you need to operate your bed. They aren’t that complex, as they’re an essential part of every Minecrafter’s playthroughs. All the way from noobs to pro, everyone has used a respawn point one time or another. Or, if you’re super advanced, you can use them as tools of mass destruction! Maybe don’t try that last part, but I implore you to get creative! With that said, I hope this pseudo guide helped you. Have a great day!</p>
