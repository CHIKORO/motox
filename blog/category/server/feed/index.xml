<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>A Ticking Entity crash will be caused when some form of data, typically a&nbsp;mob&nbsp;or block, in the world becomes corrupted. This will usually be displayed in a crash report as follows:&nbsp;java.lang.nullpointerexception: ticking entity</p>



<p>The corruption that can happen in relation to ticking entities can be so severe that anytime the game attempts to process the ticking entity it will crash. While you can see these crashes in a&nbsp;Vanilla world, you are more likely to come across this when playing a modded world. This is purely due to the fact that mods tend to change major aspects of minecraft and can be seen as a more unstable way to play the game.</p>



<h3>Minecraft Ticks</h3>



<p>Ticks are going to be involved with every game you may play. Ticks can be seen as loops of tasks a game does to synchronize itself. Minecraft runs its game loop at a fixed rate of 20&nbsp;ticks per second. This equates to 1 tick every 0.05 seconds. One good example of ticks is the daylight cycle in Minecraft. Each day is 24,000 ticks. This means 1 day in Minecraft equals 20 minutes in real life. Anything you are doing in game will be put in the same loop to be synchronized with the rest of the world.</p>



<h2>Ticking Block &amp; Ticking World</h2>



<h3>Ticking Block</h3>



<p>A Ticking Block crash is generally the same as a Ticking Entity. The difference with this crash is it is related to a block or Tile Entity specifically and not a mob or npc. This will generally be related to special blocks added from a mod.</p>



<h3>Ticking World</h3>



<p>A Ticking World crash is the most severe of them all. This will occur when the game is able to recognize that there is corruption in the world, but will not be able to give a location. The game will have no idea where the corruption occurred and in some cases this is unfixable.<br>Once you have become subjected to a Ticking Entity crash you will have to remove the data from your world to resolve it. Simply removing your mods will not work in this case. This is due to the corruption already being part of your world. Luckily there are multiple ways you can remove the errored entity from your world. Some fixes might work better than others and it will really depend on the specific crash you are facing.</p>



<p>If you discover that even after removing the errored entity the crashing keeps occurring, you may have a faulty mod. If this is the case it is important to find the specific mod/s that are causing this to be able to fix the crashes in the long run. Unfortunately there is no easy way to do this. We would recommend removing any recent additions of Mods to start. If the crashes continue you may want to start removing mods in batches until the issues stop. This will better help you narrow down which mod exactly is causing the problems.</p>



<h2>How to fix a Ticking Entity</h2>



<p>It is very important to resolve this crash as soon as possible. If the erroring entity is not removed your server may backup your world with the errored entity included. In some cases this could remove your only option to fixing the issue.</p>



<h3>Restore from Backup</h3>



<p>The absolute easiest and most straightforward way to fix the Ticking Entity is by restoring a backup() of your world. At Any Hosting we will automatically set up a backup task when you purchase a server. This task will run once per day and save up to two backups on your server at a time. We have a great guide on the restoration process&nbsp;here.</p>



<h3>Crash Reports</h3>



<p>When the server crashes due to a Ticking Entity the&nbsp;crash report&nbsp;will have very important information that can be used in the removal of the errored entity. The following information will be inside of the crash reports:</p>



<ol><li>Type of entity that caused the crash</li><li>Exact coordinates where the Ticking Entity is located.</li></ol>



<p>Below is an example of what you will typically see in a crash report if you experience a ticking entity crash.</p>

A detailed walkthrough of the error, its code path and all known details is as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>



<p>As you can see the description lets us know this is a Ticking Entity crash. If you look closely you can also see that the entity Shulker Ghast is mentioned. Upon even closer inspection you can see that this is coming from a possible mod called MMM. In this case you can do a quick google search to figure out that this entity has been added by the mod&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/5104592084804196716#">Mutated Mobs Mod</a>.</p>



<h3>Ticking World</h3>



<p>If the description in the crash report shows Ticking World or Exception ticking world you will not be able to find exact coordinates of the errored entity. This is due to the world not knowing where the issue is thus not being able to display coordinates. In these cases, we would just recommend you restore a backup() of your world.</p>



<h3>Ticking Entity</h3>



<p>If you take a look further down in the crash report you will be able to find the exact X, Y, Z Coordinates of the ticking entity. Below is an example of this information.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">A detailed walkthrough of the error, its code path and all known details is as follows:

<p>In the Entity being ticked section you will find all the important information regarding the errored entity. You can more easily see here that it indeed is a ShulkerGhast from the MMM mod. The exact location of the entity is going to be&nbsp;<code>183.54, 51.95, 67.90</code>.</p>



<h3>Cofh Killall Command to Remove Entity</h3>



<p>If you have the mod&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/5104592084804196716#">CoFH Core</a>&nbsp;you will have access to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/5104592084804196716#">/cofh killall command</a>. This command is an improved version of the default Minecraft kill command. You will not need to be connected to the server to run this command. However the server will need to be able to startup in order for the command to be run.</p>



<p>This command will have the ability to kill all creatures even in unloaded chunks on the server. This is crucial as if the chunk loads that has the ticking entity the server will end up crashing. Although CoFH Core is very common you may not have it installed. It is recommended to add this mod to your server’s&nbsp;mods&nbsp;folder to gain access to this command.</p>



<p>In order to remove all loaded entities of a specific type you can use the following command.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">/cofh killall [type]</pre>



<p>The [type] you will enter is going to be the name or part of the name of the entity type to remove from the server. You can also run without a type that will remove all hostile mobs from the server. If for some reason the type is not working you can force the command to remove ALL loaded entities with this command:&nbsp;<code>/cofh killall *</code></p>



<h3>Teleport to the Mob and Kill it</h3>



<p>This would be the “low tech” way to fix the ticking entity. Using the given coordinates from the crash report you can teleport to the entity and in the split second before the crash attempt to kill it in one hit. We recommend putting yourself into creative mode with /gamemode creative and getting a weapon that could instantly kill the entity.</p>



<p>Once you are in creative mode and have a weapon ready you can run the /teleport command to travel to the entity and start swinging away.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">/teleport X Y Z</pre>



<h3>Forge Mod Loader (DANGER)</h3>



<p>One other way to fix the Ticking Entity would be by enabling certain features within the Forge Modloader.&nbsp;Forge&nbsp;will have two settings that will order Minecraft to remove any mobs or blocks that would cause the server to crash. This method of resolution is completely uncontrollable as forge will be given permission to remove anything and everything it deems necessary. If you have ever watched forge startup in console you will know that it will almost always give warnings or errors about one thing or another. This could cause forge to remove things you do not want it to.</p>



<p>WARNING:&nbsp;If you attempt to use this method, make a backup of your server. We cannot stress how much damage this can do to your world, and the damage cannot be fixed. The only way to undo these changes is to restore a backup made before you turned on these settings in Forge, or by restoring a saved copy of your world.&nbsp;Customer Support&nbsp;can not restore any parts of a world deleted by Forge because of these settings, unless you made a backup beforehand.</p>



<p>To turn on these settings, you must find the file forge.cfg, which is normally located in the config folder in the main directory. Select forge.cfg, and then click the edit button to the right of the file.</p>



<p>Find the word false and change it to true. It’s recommended to only turn on the setting appropriate to what you are trying to fix: If trying to correct a Ticking Entity change the one for removeErrorEntities to true, but leave the removeErroringTileEntities set to false. This will hopefully minimize the side effects.</p>



<p>Start the server up, let it finish running. Then immediately shut the server down, open up forge.cfg and change those settings back to false. Leaving them permanently set to true can have continuous side effects. Place a block, and it instantly disappears, because forge didn’t like it and zapped it out of existence.</p>



<p>Try connecting into your game, and check to make sure everything is okay. If you see entire structures and buildings gone, well, that’s the damage we were talking about. If this happened, restore the backup made before turning on the&nbsp;Forge settings, and try one of the other alternative methods of removing the Ticking Entity.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>For years,&nbsp;Minecraft&nbsp;has been known as one of the world’s most popular video games. While many may think that this is due to the expansive features and seemingly endless possibilities in single-player, one of the main reasons is the ability to play Minecraft with your friends – even those who are far away.</p>



<p>Minecraft singleplayer is great for sure, however, one can really expand their gameplay experience simply by playing multiplayer with others. There are many ways to play with friends, including LAN servers which allow you to connect with players who are on the same internet as you, Realms which allow you to play across the globe, and servers which is by far the most popular option as it allows you to play modded Minecraft with your friends. You may be wondering how you can play Minecraft online and which option is best for you. That is why in this guide we’ll be breaking down the different ways to connect and play together.</p>



<h2>How to Play Minecraft with Friends on PC</h2>



<h3>LAN World</h3>



<p>In Minecraft, you have the ability to connect with friends through LAN. This will be accessible only to others within your local network. For example, if your friend is over at your house and connected to your wifi, you can create a LAN world to join.</p>



<p>How to make a LAN world</p>



<ol><li>Open up Minecraft, and join your single-player world.</li><li>Press the escape key to open up your Game Menu.</li><li>Press “Open to LAN”, then select if you want to allow cheats and what game mode you want the other users to have, then press “Start LAN World”.</li></ol>



<p>How to join a LAN world</p>



<ol><li>In Minecraft, click on the “Multiplayer” tab.</li><li>Scroll to the bottom of the list, you should see a message that says “Scanning for games on your local network”.</li><li>Once it finds the world, you will see a listing named “LAN World” with your friends username and the world name under it.</li><li>Double click it to join, or select it and press “Join Server”.</li></ol>



<h3>Minecraft Server</h3>



<p>Owning a Minecraft server is one of the best ways for you and your friends to connect with each other through Minecraft. Having your own server stands on top of the other options for a few reasons: You can set it to any version of Minecraft, you can modify it past Vanilla, and servers don’t cap the number of players who can join (of course, you would need a powerful server depending on the number of players you want online.) Playing Minecraft Java Edition with friends on a modded server is one of the most flexible, and fun, ways to enjoy the game.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that you cannot join a Bedrock Edition server off of your&nbsp;Xbox, PS4, Nintendo Switch, or any other similar platform. It can only be joined from PC (Windows 10 Edition), IOS, and Android.</p>



<p>The directions on creating a server are directed to creating one through Any Hosting. You can also create one on your home computer, but this is not recommended as many factors play into owning a server such as DDoS protection, 24/7 uptime, support, etc. All of which are provided by Any Hosting Comapny.</p>



<p>How to create a Minecraft Server</p>



<ol><li>Head to the&nbsp;pricing page&nbsp;on our website. You are going to see a few different plans here. We have a guide that goes over how much ram you will need&nbsp;here.</li><li>Once you decide what plan you want, go ahead and click on “Order Now”, then proceed to follow the instructions.</li><li>Once you have paid for your server, you will receive an email with all of your account information for our Game Panel. With Hosting, the server is created for you.</li><li>On the Game Panel, you will see your IP address. This can be used to connect to the server.</li></ol>



<p>How to join a Minecraft Java Edition Server</p>



<ol><li>Open Minecraft and go into the “Multiplayer” tab.</li><li>Towards the bottom, click on “Add Server”. Put any name under “Server Name” and then enter the server IP address and port, then press “Done”.</li><li>After pressing done, this will take you back to the multiplayer tab, you should see the server now listed. Select the server and press “Join Server”. You should now be connected to the server.</li></ol>



<p>How to join a Minecraft Bedrock Edition Server</p>



<ol><li>Open Minecraft and press “Play”.</li><li>Select the “Servers” tab, then press “Add Server”.</li><li>Fill in any name for “Server Name”, then type in the IP address without the port into the “Server Address” slot. After that, fill in the “Port” slot with your server port.</li><li>Press “Save”, then scroll down and click on the server to join it.</li></ol>



<h3>Realms</h3>



<p>Alternatively, if you do not want to use server hosting, you can use Minecraft’s built-in Realm’s. This is not recommended as Realm’s does not allow the use of mods/plugins, it limits player slots significantly and restricts who can and cannot join, and it’s quite pricey for what you are getting. Ontop of all of that, you do not get any of the benefits that come along with server hosting such as 24/7 support, one-click&nbsp;modpack&nbsp;and gametype installations, the ability to create a public world that anyone can join, and much more. However, if you want to play Minecraft with friends on Xbox, PS4 or Switch.</p>



<p>How to create a Realms Server for Java Edition</p>



<ol><li>Open Minecraft and press “Minecraft Realms”</li><li>To the bottom of Minecraft, click on “Buy Realm”. This will take you to Minecraft’s website where you can set up your subscription.</li><li>If you already had a Realm setup, you will see a listing with it. You can press “Subscribe” which will also take you to Minecraft’s website so you can set up the Realms.</li><li>Once you have paid for it, head back to the Realms tab in Minecraft and you should see the listing with a green light. Press it and then click the “Play” button.</li></ol>



<p>How to join a Realms Server in Java Edition</p>



<ol><li>To join a Realms Server, you must have been invited.</li><li>To invite someone to your Realms, go to Configure Realms, then press the Players tab.</li><li>Click on the + and type in your friend’s username to send them an invitation.</li><li>To the top of your Realms page, you should see a little icon named “New Invitations!”. If you click that, you can see the Realms you have been invited to. Simply select it and press “Play”.</li></ol>



<p>How to create a Realms Server for Bedrock Edition</p>



<ol><li>Open Minecraft, and click “Play”.</li><li>On this page, you will need to be in the “Worlds” tabs.</li><li>If you are signed in to an Xbox Live account, you can start a new Realms by clicking on “Create New”. Once you click that, you can either create a new world or use a premade Realms world.</li><li>If you aren’t signed in, you can use the free 30-day trial option. Locate the section named “Realms” at the top and click on the listing for your Realm.</li><li>Click on “Buy Now” and follow the instructions to pay for your first month.</li></ol>



<p>How to join a Realms Server in Bedrock Edition</p>



<ol><li>You need to be invited to a Realms in order to join it.</li><li>You can invite a player by clicking on the pencil icon next to your Realm’s name, then select “Members”.</li><li>Click the “Share” tab which will bring up an invite link. Send this link to your friends. This will prompt them to sign in/sign up to their Xbox Live account, then it will add them to your Realm’s&nbsp;whitelist.</li><li>If you are invited to your friend’s Realm, click on the “Friends” tab and you should see a listing, select it to join.</li></ol>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>It’s time to jump into the world of Minecraft along with your friends! With so many different ways to join, you may have trouble deciding which is the best option for you. If you want to just play Vanilla Minecraft with people who live in the same house as you, the LAN option is the best. If you want to play Vanilla Minecraft with a few friends across the world, either Realms or a server is best. Having the server&nbsp;would be more cost-effective&nbsp;than realms as they are generally going to be cheaper than the Realm’s starting price at $3.99 for just 2 players. Minecraft Servers also allow for customizations such as plugins and mods, and for expansion globally so your server can attract more than just your group of friends. If you host your server with Hosting Company, you also get access to our premade gametypes, modpacks, 24/7 support, and customized game panel. All of this information may seem like quite a bit, but once you get the hang of it, it’s not too bad. Playing Minecraft with friends adds a whole new experience to the game.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>When you create your&nbsp;server, you probably expect to have every permission/command. You may want to give other players access to every command as well. For Minecraft servers, this is done simply by making yourself Op. Being Op basically gives you every permission the server has to offer. This is what allows you to use commands such as /gamemode. &nbsp;The owner of the server is automatically set however you may want to set other players as operators. We will be walking you through the different levels of OP, how to set a server operator and how to remove an operator.<br>In the&nbsp;1.7.10 update, Op Permission Levels were added. These allow you to control how much control on the server the operators will have. If you want to add individual permissions for certain players/groups, you will need a plugin such as PermissionsEx.</p>



<h2>How to set and remove OP</h2>



<p>How to set someone to OP on your Minecraft server</p>



<ol><li>Head to the game panel and to the left click on the console tab.</li><li>In the command line type “op ” and press enter.</li><li>You should see a message that says “Player is now an operator”.</li><li>You can also do this in-game by typing “/op ”. You must be opped in order to use this command.</li></ol>



<p>How to unop someone on your Minecraft server</p>



<ol><li>Head to the game panel and to the left click on the console tab.</li><li>In the command line type “deop ” and press enter.</li><li>You should see a message that says “Player is no longer an operator”.</li><li>You can also do this in-game by typing “/deop ”. You will need to be opped in order to use this command.</li></ol>



<h2>OP levels</h2>



<p>Levels<br>Each OP level inherits the levels before it. So for example, level 3 also has the commands and abilities of level 2 and level 1. The Op Permission Levels were released during the 1.7.10<br>development, so this will not apply to any version under 1.7.10.</p>



<ul><li>Level 1 – This will allow server operators to bypass the default spawn protection. This is the lowest level of OP and does not have any commands included.</li><li>Level 2 – If you have level 2 set, operators will be able to use the following commands: /gamerule, /give, /effect, /clear, /difficulty, /summon, /tp, /gamemode, and /setblock. They will also have permission to edit&nbsp;command blocks.</li><li>Level 3 – This level will allow server operators to use the following commands: /ban, /kick, /deop, and /op.</li><li>Level 4 – This is the highest level of OP, it allows server operators to use the /stop command.</li></ul>



<p>How to set the OP level</p>



<ol><li>Head to the game panel and stop the server.</li><li>To the left of the panel, click on “Config Files”.</li><li>Click “Server Settings” and locate “Op Permission Level”.</li><li>On the dropdown, you will see all of the levels you can set. Choose which level you want the server operators to have and press Save.</li><li>Start the server.</li></ol>



<h2>Common Issues</h2>



<p>Not having access to all of the commands even when you are opped<br>If you have Opped yourself but still do not have permissions like /gamemode, it is likely that you have the wrong OP level set. You can edit this by stopping the server, going to config files, “Server Settings”, locating/changing “Op Permission Level” to your desired level, saving, then starting the server back up.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>Adding a Resource Pack to your&nbsp;Minecraft server&nbsp;is an excellent way to bring excitement to the visual aspects of your community’s gameplay. With thousands of texture packs, there are endless possibilities to create your perfect server. While installing a resource pack to your server can be tricky, we will walk you through the process to ensure a smooth installation.</p>



<h2>How to Install</h2>



<p>Finding a pack:</p>



<ol><li>The pack needs to come from an official website such as CurseForge (<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/750870351060855106#">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs</a>).</li><li>Confirm that the resource pack is made for the version of Minecraft your server is running.</li><li>Download the pack to a known directory on your computer.</li></ol>



<h2>Setting Up Dropbox</h2>



<ol><li>Sign into the Dropbox website.</li><li>To the right of the Dropbox site, click the “Upload Files” button.</li><li>Navigate to your chosen resource pack on your computer, select it, and click “Open”.</li><li>Wait for the file to upload.</li><li>When it has finished click done.</li><li>Find your texture pack in the Dropbox file list and press the share button.</li><li>Ensure that your link settings for the file are set to “Anyone with the link can see it.”</li><li>Copy the link to your clipboard.</li></ol>



<h2>Configuring Your Server</h2>



<ol><li><ol><li>Login to your Multicraft panel, select and stop your Minecraft server.</li><li>Click on “Files” and then “Config Files“</li><li>Click server settings.</li><li>In the “resource-pack=” field, paste the public link you copied from Dropbox.</li><li>The public link you copied from Dropbox must be changed from https://www.dropbox.com/somestring…?dl=0 to https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/somestring…?dl=1 You have to change the 0 at the end to 1.</li><li>Click save at the bottom of the page</li><li>Start your server again.</li></ol>&nbsp;Common IssuesFPS is dropping after you install the packIf a player is getting this issue, the resource pack may be too intense for their computer to handle. Using a less demanding pack for the server will allow players to use the pack with less worry for lag.Players clicking Yes on the resource pack popup but nothing changes.If when the player clicks “Yes” on the popup and nothing happens, this is generally due to an issue with the link inputted in the server settings. First, make sure that the Dropbox was set to “Anyone with the link can see it.” and that the link was changed from https://www.dropbox.com/somestring…?dl=0 to https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/somestring…?dl=1. This can also be from the texture pack not being made for the server version you are running.</li></ol>

<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>There are many great ways to further customize your Minecraft gameplay. One of the easiest ways to customize your server is with the use of datapacks. You can use datapacks to add new advancements, functions, loot tables, structures, and more. This is a great alternative to adding mods/plugins onto your server as it does not require installation client-side or for you to&nbsp;change your server version&nbsp;from Vanilla Minecraft. Keep in mind that they are only made for&nbsp;Java Edition&nbsp;and not&nbsp;Bedrock Edition. Datapacks can be added to your&nbsp;Minecraft server&nbsp;easily and we will walk you through each step of the process.</p>



<h2>How to add datapacks</h2>



<p>Finding a pack</p>



<ol><li>The pack needs to come from an trusted site such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/4088392038441191749#">Vanilla Tweaks</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/4088392038441191749#">Gamemode 4</a>.</li><li>Confirm that the datapack you want to download is made for the version of Minecraft that your server is running.</li><li>Download the pack to a known directory on your computer. It generally downloads as a .zip, do not extract this.</li></ol>



<p>Uploading the datapack to the server</p>



<ol><li>Stop your server</li><li>Access your server files through an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/4088392038441191749#">FTP</a>&nbsp;client such as FileZilla.</li><li>Open the world folder and then enter the datapacks directory.</li><li>Make sure that you are opening the world folder that your server is set to load. You can check the name of world your server is loading in the world field on the main page of the game panel.</li><li>Drag the datapack you downloaded previously into the datapacks folder.</li><li>Once the file is fully uploaded, head back to the game panel and start the server.</li></ol>



<p>Commands<br>The datapack command was added after 1.13, so these are not relevant for any versions under 1.13.</p>



<ul><li>/datapack disable: Disables a datapack of choosing</li><li>/datapack enable: Enables a datapack of choosing</li><li>/datapack list: List all of the enabled/disabled datapacks</li></ul>



<h2>Common Issues</h2>



<p>Datapack doesn’t show in the server<br>The datapack not showing is generally from the file not being uploaded to the correct directory. Enter your world folder, than datapacks folder to ensure that the datapack is properly uploaded. Also, make sure that you did not unzip the pack. If you check both of these and still are experiencing issues, make sure that the datapack is made for the same version of Minecraft that your server is running.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>One of the great ways to customize your&nbsp;Minecraft server&nbsp;is with plugins. With thousands of plugins, your server has endless possibilities from creating Factions to having an online map of your server. Dynmap is an awesome way to expand your server outside of the normal Minecraft gameplay. With this plugin, you can create an online webpage that essentially works like a google map for your Minecraft worlds. Many plugins can also be implemented into the Dynmap map such as&nbsp;Factions&nbsp;and Towny. If you are looking for a way to enhance your server further, Dynmap is the way to go. The setup process is decently easily and we will walk you through each step of it.</p>



<h2>How to install Dynmap</h2>



<p>Install through the panel</p>



<ol><li>Make sure your server is running Bukkit, Spigot, or Paper. You can check this in the jar dropdown on the game panel dashboard.</li><li>To the left of the game panel, press the Plugins List tab.</li><li>Type in “Dynmap” in the name search and scroll until you find it. Then click on it to open the download page.</li><li>At the bottom of the page, check the version you have selected. It’s good to cross-reference this to the official Bukkit or Spigot page.</li><li>Find the correct version from the version dropdown, select it and press install.</li><li>Go back to the Game Panel and restart your server. You can check if the plugin was installed successfully by typing “pl” into the console.</li></ol>



<p>Install through FTP</p>



<ol><li>Go to the official Dynmap page on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/2752919920969240836#">Bukkit</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/2752919920969240836#">Spigot</a>&nbsp;and click on the File tab.</li><li>Find the update that is compatible with your server version and press the download icon.</li><li>Head to the Game Panel and click FTP File Access to the left of the panel.</li><li>Once you login to the FTP File Access you will see a list of your files. Open the plugins folder and click “Upload” to the top left of the page.</li><li>Drag your plugin over to the right side of the page and wait for it to reach 100%.</li><li>Head back to the Game Panel and restart your server. The plugin should now be installed. You can check this by typing “pl” into the console.</li></ol>



<h2>How to setup Dynmap</h2>



<p>Configuration</p>



<ol><li>Stop your server.</li><li>To the left of the game panel, click FTP File Access, then enter the plugins folder.</li><li>Find the folder named Dynmap and open it, then locate the file named configuration.txt and press edit to the right of it.</li><li>Once in the configuration, locate deftemplatesuffix and set it to vlowres or lowres.</li><li>Scroll down to webserver-port and change it to any four digit port higher than 1024. The default port set is generally taken by someone else so you must use a random one.</li><li>Locate image-format: and set it to jpg.</li><li>Press Save, head back to the game panel and start your server.</li><li>Once the server has fully started, go to your console and type in “dynmap fullrender WORLDNAME”.</li></ol>



<h2>How to add a resource pack</h2>



<p>Finding a pack:</p>



<ol><li>The pack needs to come from an trusted website such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/2752919920969240836#">CurseForge</a>.</li><li>Confirm that the resource pack is made for the version of Minecraft your server is running.</li><li>Download the pack to a known directory on your computer.</li></ol>



<p>Adding to Dynmap</p>



<ol><li>Stop your server.</li><li>To the left of the game panel, click FTP File Access, then enter the plugins folder.</li><li>Find the folder named Dynmap and open it, then open the texturepacks folder.</li><li>To the left of the page click Upload and drag in the pack you previously downloaded.</li><li>Wait until it is fully uploaded and then go back one directory to the main Dynmap folder.</li><li>Locate the file named shaders.txt and press edit to the right of it.</li><li>You are going to want to clear the current contents of this file and add the following:<br><code></code>shaders: &#8211; class: org.dynmap.hdmap.TexturePackHDShader name: stdtexture texturepack: (Full name of texturepack here)<code></code></li><li>From this, the only part you will be changing is “texturepack:”. In this spot, you will put the full name of the file including the extension. For example, “texturepack: Faithful+1.13.2-rv2.zip”.</li><li>Once you get that set, save the file and head back to the game panel.</li><li>Start your server and you will want to do a full render of the map by typing dynmap fullrender into the console.</li></ol>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Dynmap is a great way to customize your Minecraft server. You can integrate your region plugins such as Towny or Factions to really bring a realistic feel to your community. While Dynmap is great, make sure that you are only using it if your server has enough resources to support it as it can be a bit resource intensive. However, you can upgrade your server at any time!</p>



<p>To upgrade your server, log in to your billing area at the top of the site. In the top menu select services, my services, select the server you want to upgrade, then hit the upgrade/downgrade option. You can select your upgrade there. After you have paid simply restart the server for the upgrade to be applied.</p>



<h2>Common Issues</h2>



<p>Port is taken<br>When configuring Dynmap, it’s important that you change the webserver-port to a random 4 digit number. If you run into an error saying the port is taken, you will need to change it to another number.</p>



<p>Hi res causing performance issues<br>It is very important to set the deftemplatesuffix to vlowres or lowres, if you do not to this you will almost always run into performance issues on the server.</p>



<p>Using MySQL and not FileTree<br>Maps can become several gigabytes in size, which can tank your MySQL performance. It is best you use the default setting, FileTree.</p>



<p>Texture pack not loading<br>If you have set the texture pack and it is still not working, there are a few things you need to check for. The first is that you set the “texturepack:” section to the exact filename of the resource pack you uploaded. If that’s correct, check that the resource pack you downloaded is made for the same version of Minecraft that you are running.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;How to Read Minecraft Crash Reports</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/7383508844279984698#"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CpQiDHwbPrc/X-8DXDpMRkI/AAAAAAAAABk/elJ_fAe3ggcvFL45DjBKCRS3-4gnz5nrACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h360/minecraft-1106261_1280.webp" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p><strong><br></strong></p>



<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>Many times when modifying a server you may experience issues with the&nbsp;server crashing. These crashes are generally caused by either mods, the world, or the server jar. When a server crashes, it generates a crash report in the FTP File Access. These crash reports break down why the server crashes and can help you get a better understanding of what’s wrong and how to fix it. At first look, it may seem confusing but all crash reports are similar and once you know what to look for you will be able to accurately read Minecraft crash reports.</p>



<h2>Understanding a Crash Report</h2>



<p>Where to find the crash reports</p>



<ol><li>Head to your Game Panel and to the left, press FTP File Access and log in.</li><li>Once in FTP File Access, you will see a folder named `crash-reports`. Go ahead and click that. Looking inside of that directory you will notice a file or multiple files.</li><li>Every file is written with the date (2019-08-17) which makes it easy to know when each report was made. When there are several files it’s always best to look at the latest and most recent crash to identify the issue.</li><li>To read the crash report, click the “edit” link to the right of the file.</li></ol>



<p>Reading the Crash Report</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">---- Minecraft Crash Report ----
// Everything's going to plan. No, really, that was supposed to happen.

Time: 1/24/20 7:25 AM
Description: Exception in server tick loop

Missing Mods:
	unknown : need [1.5.2,): have missing

net.minecraftforge.fml.common.MissingModsException: Mod thaumcraft (Thaumcraft) requires [baubles@[1.5.2,)]
	at net.minecraftforge.fml.common.Loader.sortModList(Loader.java:266)
	at net.minecraftforge.fml.common.Loader.loadMods(Loader.java:572)
	at net.minecraftforge.fml.server.FMLServerHandler.beginServerLoading(FMLServerHandler.java:98)
	at net.minecraftforge.fml.common.FMLCommonHandler.onServerStart(FMLCommonHandler.java:333)
	at net.minecraft.server.dedicated.DedicatedServer.func_71197_b(DedicatedServer.java:125)
	at net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer.run(MinecraftServer.java:486)
	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)
</pre>



<p>This is the top portion of the report where it will have the date, time and stack trace. The stack trace is a report of when a program runs at a certain time in its execution. This will be primarily where we will discover the error that is causing the server or client to crash.<br>It looks like a lot but by looking carefully we can deduce the error by picking certain parts of the stack trace out. In this example, we can tell that a mod is missing due to part of the stack trace saying&nbsp;&#8220;Missing Mods: unknown : need [1.5.2,): have missing&#8221;.&nbsp;If we go down to the next line we can see that it tells&nbsp;&#8220;net.minecraftforge.fml.common.MissingModsException: Mod thaumcraft (Thaumcraft) requires [baubles@[1.5.2,)]&#8221;&nbsp;which translates to the mod Thaumcraft needs the mod Baubles version 1.5.2 in order to run properly.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">A detailed walkthrough of the error, its code path and all known details is as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

</pre>



<p>The second half of the crash report will go over your system details and the states of the mods loading in. This can be very important especially with client-side crashing as you can find our what version of Java they are running, how much ram they have allocated and the versions of the mods to be able to assist them. One of the best tools with crash reports is knowing the States in which a mod loads in. These states are as follows:&nbsp;&#8216;U&#8217; = Unloaded &#8216;L&#8217; = Loaded &#8216;C&#8217; = Constructed &#8216;H&#8217; = Pre-initialized &#8216;I&#8217; = Initialized &#8216;J&#8217; = Post-initialized &#8216;A&#8217; = Available &#8216;D&#8217; = Disabled &#8216;E&#8217; = Errored<br>You can see these states to the left of each mod. In this example, they only made it to the loaded state. So if you have a mod that was UCE that would mean the mod Unloaded, Constructed and than Errored which means there was an error with loading that particular mod causing it to crash so you now know what the exact mod causing the issue is and can look into why it&#8217;s occurring.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>There are hundreds of different reasons that your server may crash, it can be from a world issue, server jar, mods, and far more. As long as you can narrow down what the reason is, the solution should come easier. If you can narrow down it’s a world issue, you can Google the error line to see if there are any solutions or you can restore a backup. With so many different solutions to so many different problems, there isn’t a way to break down each individual error you can get.</p>

<h1><strong>&nbsp;How To Reduce Lag On MineCraft Server.</strong></h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/blog/post/edit/7469356289688488708/807727248166018332#"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V6HLsoxupFU/X-73ylBBi6I/AAAAAAAAABM/__iF1WI19xkyU7HTVNxazhynreEHBRs6QCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h360/minecraft-1106253_1280.png" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>Lets understand What is Lag in Minecraft server , Well &#8220;Mike&#8221; Server Lags To Much , and Mike Decided Lets Ask From Readers Why My Server is Lagging?<br>Lagg Yes, We say Lagg not lag in Minecraft The Extra G is for really Good Lagg.<br>&nbsp;Server Lags are of 3 Types Now You Have To Find What Type Of Lagg You have in your server.<br>The 3 type of Lagg are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Tps Lag</strong>: Like your heart , Minecraft server also beats , what your heart do it pumps oxygen in you body , same is Minecraft heart we call him Tps. Your Heart beats 84-94beats per minute , Minecraft beats more faster around&nbsp;<strong>20 tasks per second (tps).</strong>&nbsp;it perform many tasks in seconds Neither Mobs positions , Overworld Mobs position , day cycle weather cycle , world generate all that in seconds.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Ping Lag:&nbsp;</strong>Connection lag correlates directly with ping. Ping refers to the network latency between client-side, and your Minecraft server. This reflects how long in milliseconds data takes to process and travel. Having a low ping is best as lower latency provides smoother gameplay. Typically, the further away a server is from your physical location, the greater your latency will be. The best way to minimize latency is by finding a server location near you</li><li><strong>Client Lag (fps):</strong>&nbsp;Having low FPS will generally come with your game behaving slowly. If your frame rate is low enough, playing the game may feel like watching a slideshow as only a few different frames appear on your screen per second. It will make the game feel laggy, which is the last thing we want. Having a low frame rate on your server does not mean that the server is lagging but that your computer is failing to keep up with the game.</li></ul>



<p>&#8220;Mike&#8221; : oh jess , How i find what type lagg my server has.<br>&#8220;Readers&#8221; : Mike Dont worry.<br>Well&nbsp;<strong>To check tps lag</strong>&nbsp;type /tps if the server shows a tps between 20 &#8211; 18 its good , The Good Way is When you or your player says server is lagging. Type /tps if still its 18+ then its not a tps error , oh And if its below 15. Then Your Server is Going With Tps Errors.<br>THE BEST WHAT TO FIX THIS IS LIMITING NUMBER OF PLAYER with ratio of 5 players per 1 gb of ram.</p>



<h2>Detecting lag</h2>



<p>Trying to find where lag originates is not always an easy task. On client side, you can see if you have lag by checking your FPS. You can check your FPS by pressing f3 in-game on Minecraft, this will open up a little console with all of your game details. If you have a very low FPS, then you are experiencing a client-side lag.</p>



<p>Connection lag can be tested by checking your pingto the server. Having a high ping will mean that you are experiencing delays with the connection.</p>



<p>Neither of these types is related to the server performance itself though. You can check your server performance by checking the TPS. If the TPS is low, you know that something is causing your server to run behind. Detecting what exactly the reason is can be a little bit troublesome, however, if you are running Paper and Spigot, you can run a timings report to break it down for you.</p>



<h3>Timings Report</h3>



<p>Timings allow you to monitor how long it takes the plugins installed on your server to process an event. This allows you to see where lag issues arise, as a misbehaving plugin may be causing a delay in the tick loop, causing the server TPS to go below 20. To run a timings report, type “/timings on” and after about 20+ minutes, type&nbsp;“/timings paste”. This will provide you a link, go ahead and click that and wait for the web page to load. The timings report is separated into sections for each plugin. The first two sections are Minecraft’s own tick events such as loading entities, chunks, etc. The rest is divided by plugin</p>



<h2>How to Fix Server Lag</h2>



<p>Knowing how to optimize your server is vital in preventing server lag. This will be breaking down what you need to change in your server configuration to get the best possible performance without having to compromise your gameplay. We will be going through all of the steps in server optimization.</p>



<p>One of the most vital steps in lag removal is pregenerating the world. This should be done before anything else. The best way to do this is with the WorldBorder plugin. All you have to do is type&nbsp;“/wb set ”&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;“/wb fill”. This will start generating the world for you, make sure to set the radius to something reasonable like 5000 as pregeneration takes a long time.</p>



<h3>Files</h3>



<p>Some of the main files that you will want to modify to really optimize your server is the Bukkit.yml, Paper.yml, and Spigot.yml. Below we have included areas of the configuration that you will want to change and what you will want to change it to. Keep in mind when going through this, that it does not need to follow this exactly, these are highly optimized to provide your server with the highest performance possible.</p>



<p>Make sure that you turn your server off completely before changing or modifying any of the configuration files. Each of these files can be found in the main directory of the FTP File Access.</p>



<p>Bukkit.yml</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">spawn-limits:
  monsters: 50
  animals: 8
  water-animals: 3
  ambient: 1
chunk-gc:
  period-in-ticks: 400
ticks-per:
  animal-spawns: 400
  monster-spawns: 4</pre>



<p>Paper.yml</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">   max-auto-save-chunks-per-tick: 6
   optimize-explosions: false
   mob-spawner-tick-rate: 2
   disable-chest-cat-detection: true
   container-update-tick-rate: 3
   max-entity-collisions: 2

      hard: 96
    hopper:

</pre>



<p>Spigot.yml</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">  save-user-cache-on-stop-only: true
    max-tick-time:
      tile: 1000
      entity: 1000
    mob-spawn-range: 6
    entity-activation-range:
      animals: 16
      monsters: 24
      raiders: 48
      misc: 8
    merge-radius:
      exp: 4.0
      item: 6.0
   nerf-spawner-mobs: true</pre>



<h3>Plugins</h3>



<p>Changing the base server files is not the only way to reduce or get rid of lag. There are many plugins out there that their sole purpose is for lag reduction. If you know which ones to use, you can find that lag can be reduced significantly on your server simply by installing a plugin or two.</p>



<p>ClearLagg&nbsp;(1.8+)<br>Limit Pillagers&nbsp;(1.14+)<br>Village Optimiser&nbsp;(1.14.2+)<br>Entity Control&nbsp;(1.7+)<br>Mergedmob&nbsp;(1.7+)<br>Entitytick-Lag&nbsp;(1.14+)<br>Farm Limiter&nbsp;(1.7+)<br>Mob Farm Manager&nbsp;(1.7+)<br>Lag Assist&nbsp;(1.8+)</p>



<p>These plugins aren’t guaranteed to completely stop the lag on your server, your server can experience lag for many different reasons, but they are known to help with optimization and should definitely reduce lag.</p>



<h3>Helpful Mods</h3>



<p>Unfortunately with Forge, there are not any good optimization changes to the configuration files you can make. The main thing you can do to optimize your Forge server is by reducing the view distance from the server.properties file. Another way is with the use of mods, there are some mods out there that can help reduce server lag.<br>Foamfix<br>BetterFPS<br>Optifine&nbsp;(Client-Side)</p>



<p>As with plugins, adding these mods is not going to guarantee that your server will no longer lag.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>One of the most important things that you can do as a server owner is making sure that your server is optimized and lag-free. When players join a server, they don’t expect to have issues with lag. In optimizing a server, it is important that you note the different types of lag and what you can and cannot control. You may not be able to control the lag they experience client-side, but you can surely do everything on your end to optimize the server.</p>



<p>If you are running a Vanilla Minecraft server, you may think that it won’t experience lag, I mean it is the base version of Minecraft with no optimizations. Unfortunately, though, this is not true. The newer updates such as 1.14 are known to have issues when it comes to lag. One of the best things you can do to reduce this lag is by switching from Vanilla Minecraft to Paper.</p>



<p>If you are running a modded Minecraft server, Forge, there are not a lot of optimizable configuration options, unfortunately. The best thing you can do for Forge is to pregenerate the worlds in single player with the mods and reduce the view distance from the server.properties.<br>With so many different versions of Minecraft and different types of lag you can experience, as a server owner you can only control the server-side lag. If you follow everything from this guide, it should increase the performance of your server exponentially.</p>

<p id="block-e38ef6c7-8a9e-4de0-a3c8-49e66016bbd4"><em>Choosing a Minecraft Plugins is easy but , asking someone is difficult</em>. I will teach you how to choose a Minecraft Plugin a will it be best for my server. Okay first question what is your server ram? Well About 10 plugins usually take around 1gb of ram. Hoody Hell i just have 2 gb of ram. Don&#8217;t Worry , Okay How Many Players Will be playing on your server? Ah Lets 20 okay . Well 10 player in a server afk uses 1gb of ram , and 10 Active players take 2gb of ram. Also i am Focusing on Ram but ram is not important at all all comes at the Number of Core you server cpu has.<br>﻿</p>



<p id="block-97db9c7a-e45d-454b-874d-a5f01931a932"><em>3core of cpu , 2gb ram = 2core of cpu , 10gb ram = 1core of cpu , 32gb ram.</em><br><br>Okay Leave it The Key is Limit the No. of plugins you need. I am taking for Now That I have 4gb ram , and Forget About Cores And All That.<br><br>I My Server Cracked Server ?<br>Trust me This question is very important , Cuz many Minecraft Launchers come with Freedom to choose any name. Lets Say &#8220;Mike&#8221; has a server and has all power to create or destroy anything inside the world. Now &#8220;Mike&#8217;s Friend&#8221; &#8220;Mascot&#8221; Loves to Troll everyone , One Day Mascot Can change his username to Mike come in Server and Can Do Something like this.</p>
